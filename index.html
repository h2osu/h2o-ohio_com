						 h2o Ohio is a collection of college churches that seek to bring the timeless message of Christ to Ohio's universities. We are presently on four campuses, and will be planting our fifth h2o at the University of Toledo in 2012. If you, or someone you know is attending one of these universities, we would love to meet you.

We love being able to share the hope of Jesus in a place where Christianity is stereotypically oppossed or forgotten. We do not seek to just provide a social group, but a one stop place where community, discussion groups, Bible studies, service projects, Sunday services and mission trips can all be found. We don't want college students to be a small part on the sidelines of spirituality while in school. We want them to enjoy participating in the great plan that God has for their life. By bringing the church to them, on campus, we foster greater participation, greater community, and deeper committment. We have a passion to meet a special niche in our county - tomorrow's leaders - and help them in every way we can experience the Living Water.
